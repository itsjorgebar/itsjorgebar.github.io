Hello there 👋🏼 I'm Jorge <span style="color:grey">(pronounced HOR-heh)</span> 

I work at <a href='https://labs.google/'>Google Labs</a>  building new GenAI tools for creators. I'm a  generalist 👨🏻‍💻 with strong CS fundamentals and a deep passion for applying ML to real-world problems. LLM-powered agents have me hooked! 

For recreation 🌈 I run trails, study math, share stories with friends, and give back through charity.

You can reach me via email (`contact@jorgebar.com`) or social media (`@itsjorgebar`) 📲
