Hello there 👋🏻 I'm Jorge <span style="color:grey">(pronounced HOR-heh)</span> 

I work at <a href='https://labs.google/'>Google Labs</a>  building new GenAI tools for creators. I'm a full-stack developer 🛠️ specializing in back-end <span style="color:grey">(APIs, Distributed Systems, ML)</span>. My core principles are clarity, purpose, and speed.

For recreation 🌀 I run trails, prove theorems, share stories with friends, and appreciate each breath. 

You can reach me via email (`contact@jorgebar.com`) or social media (`@itsjorgebar`).
